# FreeBSD ports midori overlay

I tried upgrading to midori 10.0.4, but was not able to make it work properly.

I could not find any upstream documentation on how to properly build.

This ports actually builds a working and usable browser, but it just looks like a firefox nightly build.

If anyone wants to try to make it work properly this could be a good starting point.
