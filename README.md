# FreeBSD ports midori overlay

I tried upgrading to midori 10.0.4, but was not able to make it work properly.

I could not find any upstream documentation on how to properly build.

Also, it looks like the upstream public repository lags behind some internal one. At the time of writing he latest relase in the repo is `10.0.4` while the website is announcing version `11.0`.

This ports actually build a working and usable browser, but it just looks like a firefox nightly build.

If anyone wants to try to make it work properly this could be a good starting point.
